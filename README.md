- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time draft updates using WebSockets
- ðŸ”„ Snake draft format (order reverses each round)
- ðŸ“± RESTful API endpoints for draft management
- ðŸŽ® Simple and intuitive draft flow
- ðŸ”” Real-time notifications to all connected clients
- ðŸ‘¥ Team registration system
- ðŸŽ² Automatic draft order randomization

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- WebSocket support
- pytest (for testing)
- flake8 (for linting)
